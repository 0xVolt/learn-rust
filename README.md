# An Introduction to `Rust`

The intent of this repository is to acquire a basic understanding of Rust and to see if this is something that piques my interest enough for me to specialise in it.

## What is Rust?

Rust is an extremely fast systems language like C, C++ and GoLang that is often used to develop tools that programmers use like compilers, drivers, etc. Rust is a young, up-and-coming language that is changing the face of web development too with a framework called Web Assembly. WASM is an efficient low-level byte-code for the web which will allow us to build very secure, portable and fast web applications.

Rust is statically and strongly typed and is a compiled language.

## Why learn Rust?

One of the biggest advantages of Rust, apart from it's extremely friendly compiler that holds your hand through your development journey, is that it doesn't use garbage collection and it doesn't require you to manage memory. With C and C++, managing memory becomes tedious and Rust avoids all of this by checking the memory heap on demand. So whenever it is close to being full, the compiler takes care of clearing up memory so the developer doesn't need to worry about it.

Like Python has `pip`, Rust has it's own package manager called `Cargo`. I'll go into greater detail about how to install and integrate packages into projects using `Cargo`.
