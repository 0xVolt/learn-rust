# An Introduction to `Rust`

## What is Rust?

Rust is an extremely fast systems language like C, C++ and GoLang that is often used to develop tools that programmers use like compilers, interpreters, etc. Rust is a young, up-and-coming language that is changing the face of web development too with a framework called Web Assembly. WASM is an efficient low-level byte-code for the web which will allow us to build very secure, portable and fast web applications.

## Why learn Rust?

The intent of this repository is to acquire a basic understanding of Rust and to see if this is something that piques my interest enough for me to specialise in it.
